Redis 2.4 release notes

Migrating from 2.2 to 2.4
=========================

Redis 2.2 is mostly a strict subset of 2.4.
The only thing you should be aware is that you can't use .rdb and AOF files
generated with 2.4 into a 2.2 instance.

2.4 slaves can be attached to 2.2 masters, but not the contrary, and only for
the time needed to perform the version upgrade.

From the point of view of the API Redis 2.4 only adds new commands
(other commands now accepts a variable number of arguments) so you don't need
to modify your program in order to use Redis 2.4.

  final part of a long list.
* redis-cli now implements a --latency mode to monitory Redis delay.
* Hash type settings removed from INFO (same info is available via config GET)
* Include port number on error when can't bind.
* AOF fsync is now performed in background when fsync policy is 'everysec'.
* AOF performances improved moving in background a possibly slow close(2) call.

WHAT'S NEW IN REDIS 2.4 compared to the 2.2 version?
====================================================

* Specially encoded sorted sets, now small sorted sets will use little memory.
* Native persistence of specially encoded data types (ziplists, zipmaps,
  intsets). Many data sets will be saved and loaded an order of magnitude
  faster.
* Variadic versions of commands: SADD, HDEL, SREM, ZREM, ZADD, L/RPUSH.
* Jemalloc support (enabled by default for Linux build) in order to
  avoid fragmentation issues.
* Reduced memory usage while saving.
* More info fields (peak memory, fork time, ...)
* OBJECT command for objects introspection.
* CLIENT command for clients introspection.
* Non blocking slave -> master connection.
* Better redis-cli connection handling. New redis-cli features.
* Better redis-benchmark, now able to benchmark user provided commands.
